## 🧪 Quick Example (Python)
```python
import easyPyEngine as epe

engine = epe.Engine("My Game", 800, 600)

sprite = epe.Sprite()
sprite.add_image(engine, "path/to/image.png", 100, 100)

sp2 = epe.Sprite()
sp2.add_rect(100, 100, (255, 0, 0), 1)

x = 100
y = 400
speed = 200

def update(dt):
    global x, y

    engine.clear(color=(135, 206, 235))
    engine.draw_rect(0, 500, 800, 600, (124, 252, 0), 1)

    sp2.draw(engine, 100, 400)
    sprite.draw(engine, x, y)

    if engine.is_key_pressed("w"):
        sprite.height += 2
    if engine.is_key_pressed("s"):
        sprite.height -= 2
    if engine.is_key_pressed("a"):
        x -= speed * dt
    if engine.is_key_pressed("d"):
        x += speed * dt

engine.run(update)
engine.quit()

```
